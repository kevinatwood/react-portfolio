    <p class="card-text">Welcome to my developer profile! I am a current middle school teacher looking to transition into a career in  tech and software engineering. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I discovered I had a passion for web development and using automation and technology to streamline processes and make life more efficient. I enrolled in the Univeristy of Minnesota's Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp and graduated in November of 2023. I have always loved puzzles and problem solving, and while challenging, I have enjoyed every step of my development journey so far! <br></br><br></br> Please explore my developer profile and check out my projects! You can also view my resume and contact information. I look forward to connecting with you! </p>
